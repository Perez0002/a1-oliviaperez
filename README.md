I had problems with Glitch, reopening projects would cause it to get stuck on the loading screen for an unbearably long time, and it somehow couldn't apply the .css file, images, or animation. However, I experimented with Github Pages in the past and decided to try hosting my project with Pages instead. This kept my css, images, and animation.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
1. Rules for the body: website background color and baloo2 font (learned from first class), not challenging
2. Rules for h1 and h2: dangrek font and unique colors (learned from first class), not challenging
3. Rules for article: set font to larger, unique color (learned from first class), not challenging
4. Rules for footer: smaller font size, same color as h1 (learned from W3 Schools), not challenging-results from googling "semantic html tags"
5. Rules for tables: border thickness and color, cell padding, and unique font color (learned from W3 Schools), not challenging-results from googling "semantic html tags"
- **Semantic HTML tags**:
1. article: contains requested information (learned from first class), not challenging
2. table: contains my experience skills (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging 
3. footer: contains the IBM and WPI bullet points (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
4. figure: contains a photo of myself (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
5. nav: contains a hyperlink to a past project (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
- **Simple Animation**: Edited sample code based on W3 Schools code and alessiomaddaluno on Github to make an image move from one corner of a canvas to the other. I wanted to make the image bounce back and forth like the dvd logo, so I found existing projects to help, hence finding code from alessiomaddaluno. This was moderately challenging since I never coded this type of animation before.
## Design Achievements
- **Google Fonts**: I used Danrek (h1 and h2 font) and Baloo2 (article font) from Google fonts in my site.
- **Coolers Color Palette**:
1. first color: h1 font color, table border, footer font color
2. second color: body background color, table background color, canvas background color
3. third color: hyperlink color, table font color
4. article font color
5. h2 font color
