## Option 1 - Clone to computer, push to Github, import to Glitch (recommended)

1. Fork the starting assignment code in GitHub. This repo contains the following:
    * The server code, `server.js`
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
    * A package.json file that helps configure Glitch
    * This README
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
3. Complete some technical and/or design achievements (see below).

5. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this
   locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory and then going to `localhost:3000` in
   your browser.
6. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
7. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub.
8. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this
   by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875). Note the
   following:
    * You will need to create a Glitch account first, but Glitch makes it easy by giving you the option to log in via
      your GitHub account.
    * The instructions in the medium.com post are slightly outdated. To import your GitHub repo,
      select `Import from GitHub` under `New Project`.
9. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
10. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. This helps us find your project.
    * Ignore any messages about conflicts. You do not need to resolve them.
    * Make the title of your pull request "Pull Request for NAME" (ex. "Pull Request for Joshua Cuneo")

For the Technical and Design achievements, make sure you thoroughly describe in your README what you did why it was
challenging. ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM. Remember that the
success of Achievements hinges on how well you describe them in your README. Well formatted text, images, and concise
and clear descriptions are helpful. You must include a Technical Achievements and Design Achievements section, even if
none are attempted.

Note that if you want to load resources besides your index.html file (images, an CSS file, a JS file) you'll need to
modify server.js to point to these. For now it's easiest to just hardcode paths to the resources, but we'll look at ways
to optimize this shortly.

*Basic Requirements*

(10 points each)

1. Assignment has proper naming scheme
2. Files forked from original repo
3. `index.html` properly rendered
4. `index.html` page properly edited
5. All changes pushed to GitHub
6. Project deployed to Glitch (or other hosting option)
7. Pull Request submitted to original repo

*Technical Achievements*

1. (5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be
   sure to describe your style rules in your README.
3. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
4. (5 points) Experiment with other *semantic* HTML tags (links, images, tables, header, footer, etc.). Each extra tag
   you use will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the tags you use in your README.

*Design Achievements*

1. (10 points) Create a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Use all the colors in the
   palette in your webpage by implementing the appropriate CSS. Add a small screenshot of the color wheel for your color
   palette to your repo.
2. (5 points) Use a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your website.

**NOTE:** There are additional color pallette and font options listed on Canvas under Modules -> Resources -> Color
Pallettes and Fonts. You are welcome to use one of those instead. If you know of and would like to use any other
resources that are not included, feel free to contact the instructor.
