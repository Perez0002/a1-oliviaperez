## Option 1 - Clone to computer, push to Github, import to Glitch (recommended)
5. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory and then going to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
6. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
7. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
8. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875). Note the following:
	* You will need to create a Glitch account first, but Glitch makes it easy by giving you the option to log in via your GitHub account.
	* The instructions in the medium.com post are slightly outdated. To import your GitHub repo, select `Import from GitHub` under `New Project`.
9. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
10. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. This helps us find your project.
	* Ignore any messages about conflicts. You do not need to resolve them.
	* Make the title of your pull request "Pull Request for NAME" (ex. "Pull Request for Joshua Cuneo")

For the Technical and Design achievements, make sure you thoroughly describe in your README what you did why it was challenging. ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM. Remember that the success of Achievements hinges on how well you describe them in your README. Well formatted text, images, and concise and clear descriptions are helpful. You must include a Technical Achievements and Design Achievements section, even if none are attempted.

Note that if you want to load resources besides your index.html file (images, an CSS file, a JS file) you'll need to modify server.js to point to these. For now it's easiest to just hardcode paths to the resources, but we'll look at ways to optimize this shortly.

*Basic Requirements*

(10 points each)

1. Assignment has proper naming scheme

2. Rules for h1 and h2: dangrek font and unique colors (learned from first class)
3. Rules for article: set font to larger, unique color (learned from first class)

5. Rules for tables: border thickness and color, cell padding, and unique font color (learned from W3 Schools)
- **Semantic HTML tags**:

- **Simple Animation**: Edited sample code based on W3 Schools code and alessiomaddaluno on Github to make an image move from one corner of a canvas to the other. I wanted to make the image bounce back and forth like the dvd logo, so I found existing projects to help, hence finding code from alessiomaddaluno.
