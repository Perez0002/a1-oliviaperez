## Option 1 - Clone to computer, push to Github, import to Glitch (recommended)
7. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
8. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875). Note the following:
	* You will need to create a Glitch account first, but Glitch makes it easy by giving you the option to log in via your GitHub account.
	* The instructions in the medium.com post are slightly outdated. To import your GitHub repo, select `Import from GitHub` under `New Project`.
9. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
10. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. This helps us find your project.
	* Ignore any messages about conflicts. You do not need to resolve them.
	* Make the title of your pull request "Pull Request for NAME" (ex. "Pull Request for Joshua Cuneo")

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
1. Rules for the body: website background color and baloo2 font (learned from first class), not challenging
2. Rules for h1 and h2: dangrek font and unique colors (learned from first class), not challenging
3. Rules for article: set font to larger, unique color (learned from first class), not challenging
4. Rules for footer: smaller font size, same color as h1 (learned from W3 Schools), not challenging-results from googling "semantic html tags"
5. Rules for tables: border thickness and color, cell padding, and unique font color (learned from W3 Schools), not challenging-results from googling "semantic html tags"
- **Semantic HTML tags**:
1. article: contains requested information (learned from first class), not challenging
2. table: contains my experience skills (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging 
3. footer: contains the IBM and WPI bullet points (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
4. figure: contains a photo of myself (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
5. nav: contains a hyperlink to a past project (followed example from W3 Schools), not challenging
- **Simple Animation**: Edited sample code based on W3 Schools code and alessiomaddaluno on Github to make an image move from one corner of a canvas to the other. I wanted to make the image bounce back and forth like the dvd logo, so I found existing projects to help, hence finding code from alessiomaddaluno. This was moderately challenging since I never coded this type of animation before.
## Design Achievements
- **Google Fonts**: I used Danrek (h1 and h2 font) and Baloo2 (article font) from Google fonts in my site.
- **Coolers Color Palette**:
1. first color: h1 font color, table border, footer font color
2. second color: body background color, table background color, canvas background color
3. third color: hyperlink color, table font color
4. article font color
5. h2 font color
